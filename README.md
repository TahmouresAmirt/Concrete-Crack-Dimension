# Concrete Crack Dimension Measurement

This repository contains a Google Colab notebook for measuring the dimensions of concrete cracks, specifically the width and length, using image processing techniques with OpenCV. The notebook processes images to detect crack contours, calculates their dimensions in millimeters based on DPI input, and visualizes the results with bounding boxes.

## Features
- **Image Upload**: Upload your concrete images directly in Colab.
- **Crack Dimension Measurement**: Converts images to grayscale, and applies blurring, edge detection, and thresholding to detect cracks.
- **Accurate Calculations**: Computes crack width and length using DPI for precise measurements.
- **Visualization**: Displays the original image with detected cracks outlined.

## Getting Started
1. Open the notebook in Google Colab.
2. Upload your image when prompted.
3. Enter the DPI of the image.
4. View the measured crack dimensions and visual outputs.

## Requirements
- Python
- OpenCV
- NumPy
- Google Colab environment
